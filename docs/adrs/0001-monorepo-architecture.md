# ADR-0001: Monorepo Architecture Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to decide on the architecture for the RetailEdge e-commerce platform. The platform consists of multiple frontend applications (Angular storefront, React admin) and backend services (catalog, orders, users) that need to share common types and utilities.

## Decision
We will use an Nx monorepo architecture with the following structure:

- **Frontend applications** in `apps/clients/`
- **Backend services** in `apps/services/`
- **Shared libraries** in `libs/shared/`
- **Infrastructure** in `infra/`

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Code sharing**: Common types and utilities can be shared across applications
- **Consistent tooling**: Single configuration for linting, testing, and building
- **Atomic changes**: Changes across multiple applications can be made in a single commit
- **Dependency management**: Centralized package management and version control
- **Developer experience**: Single repository to clone and work with

### Negative
- **Repository size**: Larger repository with more files
- **Build complexity**: More complex build orchestration
- **Team coordination**: Requires coordination when multiple teams work on the same repository
- **Deployment complexity**: Need to determine which applications to deploy

### Mitigation
- Use Nx's affected detection to only build/test changed applications
- Implement proper CI/CD pipelines to handle selective deployments
- Establish clear ownership and contribution guidelines
- Use proper branching strategies and code review processes
