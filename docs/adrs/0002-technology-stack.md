# ADR-0002: Technology Stack Decision

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select the technology stack for the RetailEdge e-commerce platform. The platform needs to support both customer-facing applications and administrative interfaces, with robust backend services.

## Decision
We will use the following technology stack:

### Frontend
- **Angular 17+** for customer-facing storefront
- **React 18+** for admin dashboard
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Jest** for unit testing
- **Cypress** for e2e testing

### Backend
- **Spring Boot 3.2+** for microservices
- **Java 17+** as the programming language
- **Maven** for dependency management
- **H2 Database** for development
- **JPA/Hibernate** for ORM

### Shared
- **TypeScript** for shared type definitions
- **Nx** for monorepo management
- **ESLint** for code linting
- **Prettier** for code formatting

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Docker Compose** for local development
- **pnpm** for package management

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Type safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time type checking
- **Ecosystem maturity**: All selected technologies have mature ecosystems
- **Developer experience**: Good tooling and IDE support
- **Performance**: Modern frameworks with good performance characteristics
- **Scalability**: Microservices architecture allows independent scaling

### Negative
- **Learning curve**: Multiple technologies require team training
- **Complexity**: More complex setup and maintenance
- **Bundle size**: Multiple frameworks increase overall bundle size
- **Consistency**: Need to maintain consistency across different technologies

### Mitigation
- Provide comprehensive documentation and training
- Use shared libraries for common functionality
- Implement code style guides and linting rules
- Regular team knowledge sharing sessions
