TESTING & QUALITY GATES
- Unit tests mandatory for new logic. Aim for ~70–80% line coverage in changed code.
- E2E tests cover the “happy path” for checkout.
- Lint and type-check must pass before merging.
- Add CodeQL and Dependabot; treat alerts as blocking until triaged.
- Snapshots (React) used sparingly; prefer behavior assertions.
