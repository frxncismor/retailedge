FRONTEND STANDARDS
- Language: TypeScript. Avoid 'any'. Enable strict mode.
- Angular: Prefer standalone components. Use HttpClient for APIs. Keep services stateless. Use different files such as html templates, css/scss design and typescript logic
- React: Functional components + hooks. Use React Router. Keep state local; avoid global state unless necessary.
- Accessibility: Provide labels/aria-* for interactive controls; ensure keyboard navigation.
- Performance: Code-split routes; lazy-load heavy features.
- API calls: Use a single base URL from env. Handle errors with typed results; show user-friendly messages.
- Styling: Keep CSS simple (SCSS or utility-first). No inline styles except tiny cases.

TESTING
- Angular: unit tests with TestBed/HttpTestingController for services.
- React: Jest + Testing Library; test behavior, not implementation details.
- E2E: Cypress flows for critical paths (browse products -> add to cart -> checkout).
