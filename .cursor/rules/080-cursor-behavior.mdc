CURSOR BEHAVIOR
- Before making large changes, output a concise plan (files, functions, impact).
- Prefer minimal diffs; preserve existing style and patterns.
- When editing multiple files, list each file path and the exact changes.
- If a spec is ambiguous, propose a reasonable default and proceed (do not stall).
- All auto-generated docs and comments must be in English.
