GIT & PR CONVENTIONS
- Use Conventional Commits:
  feat: new feature
  fix: bug fix
  docs: docs only
  test: tests only
  refactor: code change w/o behavior change
  chore: tooling/infra
- Branch names: feature/<short-desc>, fix/<short-desc>, chore/<short-desc>.
- PRs must be small and focused (<400 LOC changed when possible). Include:
  - Summary (what/why)
  - Screenshots for UI changes
  - Checklist: tests + docs updated, breaking changes called out
- Do not merge if CI is red. Resolve CodeQL/Dependabot alerts proactively.
