SECURITY & OBSERVABILITY
- Never commit secrets. Use secrets managers/CI secrets.
- Log with structured JSON and correlation IDs (x-request-id). No PII or tokens in logs.
- Handle timeouts and retries for downstream calls. Return meaningful 5xx with correlation id.
- Provide rate limiting or at least document expectations for public endpoints.
