DOCUMENTATION
- Write all docs in English.
- Each app/service must have a README with: What/Why, How to run locally, How to test, How to deploy, Env vars table, and Troubleshooting.
- Use Mermaid for architecture diagrams where helpful.
- Prefer imperative section titles: “Run locally”, “Test”, “Deploy”.
- Add ADRs in /docs/adrs for significant decisions (Status, Context, Decision, Consequences).
- Keep examples copy-pasteable; show exact commands.

STYLE
- Use present tense and active voice.
- One purpose per paragraph. Prefer lists and tables for configuration.
