PROJECT STRUCTURE GUARDBANDS
- Apps MUST live under:
  - Frontend: apps/clients/<app-name> (Angular/React)
  - Backend: apps/services/<service-name> (Spring Boot)
- Shared libraries MUST live under libs/shared/<lib-name>.
- Infra files MUST live under infra/**.

ENFORCEMENT
- When generating a new Angular app: use --directory=clients.
- When generating a new React app: use --directory=clients.
- When adding a new Spring service: create folder apps/services/<service-name> and a project.json wrapper with Nx run-commands for mvn (build/test/serve) similar to catalog-service.
- Never place apps directly under apps/ root.
- If any file is created in a wrong path, MOVE it to the correct location and update project.json automatically.
